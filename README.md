# sortRectangles
Sorting the rectangles given on a plane


sorting based on Y axis (y1 cordinate) first,
if boxes are at same vertical line than we choose
X axis (x1 cordinate) to differentiate.
If start point (x1, y1) is same for boxes same algo
will use end point (x2, y2).

g++ sortRect.cpp -o sortRect

./sortRect
